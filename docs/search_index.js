The project started out as an internal quick-and-dirty set of tools in the Utz research laboratory at the University of Southampton. At the time, Julia was in a very early stage, and its use was experimental. In the meantime, a sizeable number of research projects have been carried out in the group using early versions of NMR.jl, and it seemed like a good idea to complete the tools and the documentation, and make the package available to the community.","category":"page"},{"location":"About/","page":"About NMR.jl","title":"About NMR.jl","text":"note: Applications\nNMR.jl is intended to be applicable to any kind of NMR data, and aims at implementing a broad set of features to enable even advanced NMR data processing. Some of its functionality is designed for convenience, making everyday tasks  accessible with a reasonable default set of parameters. Power users may want to use the more low-level routines, which are underlying the high-level interface.","category":"page"},{"location":"NMR-1.0/#Roadmap-to-Version-1.0","page":"Roadmap to Version 1.0","title":"Roadmap to Version 1.0","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"NMR-1.0/","page":"Roadmap to Version 1.0","title":"Roadmap to Version 1.0","text":"This is a roadmap towards publishing NMR.jl first for internal use, and then  to the wider community.","category":"page"},{"location":"NMR-1.0/","page":"Roadmap to Version 1.0","title":"Roadmap to Version 1.0","text":"In its current state, NMR.jlis a package of tools that have been designed for only internal use.
