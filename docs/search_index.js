The project started out as an internal quick-and-dirty set of tools in the Utz research laboratory at the University of Southampton. At the time, Julia was in a very early stage, and its use was experimental. In the meantime, a sizeable number of research projects have been carried out in the group using early versions of NMR.jl, and it seemed like a good idea to complete the tools and the documentation, and make the package available to the community.","category":"page"},{"location":"About/","page":"About NMR.jl","title":"About NMR.jl","text":"note: Applications\nNMR.jl is intended to be applicable to any kind of NMR data, and aims at implementing a broad set of features to enable even advanced NMR data processing. Some of its functionality is designed for convenience, making everyday tasks  accessible with a reasonable default set of parameters. Power users may want to use the more low-level routines, which are underlying the high-level interface.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Home","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Contents","page":"Home","title":"Contents","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"#Example-documentation","page":"Home","title":"Example documentation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"    NMR\n    FourierTransform","category":"page"},{"location":"#NMR","page":"Home","title":"NMR","text":"module NMR\n\nprovides routines for processing 1D NMR spectra, as well as for simple Hilbert space spin dynamics simulations. \n\nVersion History\n\nv0.9.0\n\nadded JEOL data reading\n\nv0.8.0\n\nadded GISSMO library interface\n\nv0.7.1\n\nadded readBrukerParameterFile()\n\nv0.6.5\n\nadded medianBaseline() for baseline correction\nadded an entry for DSS in the HMDB table\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#NMR.FourierTransform","page":"Home","title":"NMR.FourierTransform","text":"FourierTransform(d::Data1D)\n\nperforms an FFT assuming that the input data set d is a free induction decay, and returns a DataSet object with the resulting complex data.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Here-is-a-code-example","page":"Home","title":"Here is a code example","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"ENV[\"GKSwstype\"] = \"100\" # hide\nimport NMR\nimport Plots # hide\n\nf=NMR.readBrukerFID(\"../../test/data/10/fid\")\nd=NMR.Data1D(f,0.0,1.0)\nNMR.plot(real(d))\nPlots.savefig(\"plot.svg\"); nothing # hide","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"(Image: )","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"spect=NMR.FourierTransform(d,PPM=700, CTR=4.76)\nNMR.plot(real(spect),xaxis=:flip)\nPlots.savefig(\"plot-spec.svg\"); nothing # hide","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"(Image: )","category":"page"}]
