# NMR.jl

*A set of tools for processing, plotting, and interpreting NMR data*

## Package Features

- Reading and processing NMR data from JEOL, Bruker, and Varian/Agilent Spectrometers
- Simulations of Spin dynamics based on efficient sparse matrix representations of the spin Hamiltonian and density operator
- Some specialised and advanced tools for data interpretation in the context of metabolomics
